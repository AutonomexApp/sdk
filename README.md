# Autonomex

**Autonomex** is building the first financial infrastructure designed for autonomous agents as first-class participants.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Autonomex redefines financial infrastructure for a world where AI agents, autonomous systems, and programmable entities participate directly in the economy.

We provide the rails, protocols, and controls that allow autonomous agents to:

- Transact securely
- Manage capital programmatically
- Enforce policy constraints
- Operate trust-minimized financial workflows
- Integrate seamlessly with on-chain and off-chain systems

Autonomex treats autonomous agents not as tools — but as economic actors.

## 🌐 Vision

The future economy will not be human-only.

AI agents will:
- Execute trades  
- Manage treasuries  
- Coordinate payments  
- Negotiate contracts  
- Operate digital businesses  

Autonomex builds the infrastructure layer that makes this possible — securely, transparently, and at scale.

## 🏗 Core Principles

### 1️⃣ Agent-Native Architecture  
Built from the ground up for autonomous participation.

### 2️⃣ Policy-Driven Controls  
Programmable rules and constraints to manage risk and permissions.

### 3️⃣ Auditability  
Full traceability for financial actions.

### 4️⃣ Composability  
Seamless integration with DeFi, APIs, and enterprise systems.

### 5️⃣ Security by Design  
Cryptographic guarantees, not trust assumptions.
